# SemanticTransfer
An experiment to transfer meaning from model to other

**Note: This is an experiment, the transfer is not complete, to NOT use this in any project you plan to use more then 12 hours.**

In this experiment I try to gather some information about the data model in an OPC server instance and write it out as a CDM.



## Setup
Please make sure you have some other repos next to this:

.\SemanticTransfer --> *this repo*

.\UA-.NETStandard -->[https://github.com/OPCFoundation/UA-.NETStandard]

.\CDM -->[https://github.com/microsoft/CDM]
